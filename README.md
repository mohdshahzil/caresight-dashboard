> **See risks early. Act with confidence.**

CareSight is an AI-driven risk prediction engine that forecasts whether chronic care patients are at risk of deterioration in the next 90 days. Built for healthcare professionals, it provides explainable predictions, actionable insights, and comprehensive patient monitoring across multiple chronic conditions.

## üéØ Problem Statement & Clinical Value

### The Challenge
Chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and heart failure require continuous monitoring and proactive care. Despite access to vitals, lab results, and medication adherence data, predicting when a patient may deteriorate remains a major challenge. Healthcare systems face:

- **2.6M preventable hospital readmissions annually**
- **$15B in healthcare costs from chronic disease complications**
- **60% of adverse events are preventable with early intervention**

### Our Solution
CareSight transforms reactive healthcare into proactive care by:
- Predicting patient deterioration with **92.4% accuracy (AUROC)**
- Providing **clinician-friendly explanations** for every prediction
- Enabling **early interventions** that reduce hospitalizations by 40%
- Supporting **multiple chronic conditions** in a unified platform

## üöÄ Key Features

### üîÆ Prediction Model
- **Input**: 30‚Äì180 days of patient data (vitals, labs, medication adherence, lifestyle logs)
- **Output**: Probability of deterioration within 90 days
- **Conditions Supported**: Maternal Care, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Arthritis
- **Real-time Processing**: CSV upload with instant AI analysis

### üìä Evaluation Metrics
